      <h3><b>CLOUD SERVICES</b></h3><br>
      <div class="image-container">
      <img src="cloud.png" alt="Service 1" class="same-size"></div>
      <p>The first sense of cloud services covers a wide range of resources that a service provider delivers to customers via the internet, which, in this context, has broadly become known as the cloud. Characteristics of cloud services include self-provisioning and elasticity; that is, customers can provision services on an on-demand basis and shut them down when no longer necessary. In addition, customers typically subscribe to cloud services, under a monthly billing arrangement, for example, rather than pay for software licenses and supporting server and network infrastructure upfront. In many transactions, this approach makes a cloud-based technology an operational expense, rather than a capital expense. From a management standpoint, cloud-based technology lets organizations access software, storage, compute and other IT infrastructure elements without the burden of maintaining and upgrading them.</p>

      <h3><b>DATA SECURITY</b></h3><br>
      <div class="image-container">
      <img src="data.webp" alt="Service 1" class="same-size"></div>
      
      <p>Data security is a set of processes and practices designed to protect your critical information technology (IT) ecosystem. This included files, databases, accounts, and networks. Effective data security adopts a set of controls, applications, and techniques that identify the importance of various datasets and apply the most appropriate security controls.

Effective data security takes into account the sensitivity of various datasets and corresponding regulatory compliance requirements. Like other cybersecurity postures — perimeter and file security to name a few — data security isn’t the end-all-be-all for keeping hackers at bay. Rather, data security is one of many critical methods for evaluating threats and reducing the risk associated with data storage and handling.</p>

      <h3><b>DATA BACKUP</b></h3><br>
      <div class="image-container">
      <img src="backup.jpg" alt="Service 1" class="same-size"></div>
      <p>In an increasingly digitized business landscape, data backup is vital for the survival of an organization. You can get hacked or ransomed, and lose your data to thieves who’ll sell your trade secrets to the highest bidder. Injected malware can corrupt your hard-earned information. Disgruntled employees or other insider threats can delete your valuable digital assets. Can you recover from data loss?

Data backup is a practice that combines techniques and solutions for efficient and cost-effective backup. Your data is copied to one or more locations, at pre-determined frequencies, and at different capacities. You can set up a flexible data backup operation, using your own architecture, or make use of available Backup as a Service (BaaS) solutions, mixing them up with local storage. Today, there are plenty of corporate storage TCO solutions to help you calculate costs, avoid data loss, and prevent data breaches.</p>
